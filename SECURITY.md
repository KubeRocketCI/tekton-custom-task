## Reporting a Vulnerability

The KubeRocketCI team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly on GitHub Issues or other public forums.
2. Email us at <SupportEPMD-EDP@epam.com> with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Include steps to reproduce, impact, and any potential mitigations if known.
4. Allow time for the team to investigate and address the vulnerability before any public disclosure.

## What to expect

- Acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- An initial assessment of the report within 7 days
- Regular updates about the progress of addressing the vulnerability
- Credit for discovering the vulnerability (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. Once a vulnerability is confirmed, we develop and test a fix
2. We prepare a security advisory to accompany the fix
3. We release the fix and publish the security advisory simultaneously
4. After the fix has been available for 10 days, details may be discussed publicly

## Security Best Practices

When deploying the tekton-custom-task controller:

1. Use the principle of least privilege for the controller service account
2. Keep your Kubernetes and Tekton environments updated with security patches
3. Regularly review and audit access to the controller and its resources

Thank you for helping us keep our project and our users secure!
